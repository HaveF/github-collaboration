Background
----------

You should know some basic concepts (or commands) of Git. Like,

* branch
* checkout
* clone
* remote
* push
* pull
* repository (a.k.a. "repo")

If you want to collaborate to others well, you also should know

* rebase
* commit --amend

SWC's repo maze :dizzy_face:
----------------------------

![many repos](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/raw/gh-pages/img/readme/step3.png)

It is a little bit crowded when you see it first:family::two_women_holding_hands::dolls::couple::two_men_holding_hands:

Let's forget it first.

[TODO]add the basic figure of repo and cloned repo
[TODO]explain the repo `YYYY-MM-DD-site`

Web based workflow (The easiest)
--------------------------------

Demo and practice time!
Reference: (GitHub Flow in the Browser)[https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser]

1. clone
2. **make a new branch**
3. change
4. send pr (pull request)
5. discuss with others
6. improve them

Prrrrrrrrractice items:
- [ ] Fix the `Prrrrrrrrractice` to `Practice`
- [ ] Fix the title `github-collaboration` to `GitHub-collaboration`
- [ ] Fix what ever you 
- [ ] Send A PR
- [ ] Discuss it. Include:
- [ ] Make a reference to other issue
- [ ] Reply discussion in mail
- [ ] Use @ to mention other

Prons and cons:
* Easy and quick to use
* Friendly to users (also include newbies)
* Even no need to install Git!
* Less disruptive workflows
* (x)Hard to reuse (like pull new commits from the original repo, rebase the PR)

Command line or gui tools based workflow (The most flexible)
------------------------------------------------------------

Demo time! (No practise because the limited time:sweat_smile:)


Tips
----

* Be nice, be polite, maybe you can use (EMOJI)[http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/], especially you 
are the repo's owner.
* Write the commit message more informative (On the other hand, you need to hide the commit detail)
